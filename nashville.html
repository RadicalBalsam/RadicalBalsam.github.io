        <h2>Christmas in Nashville, New Year's in Washington, D.C.</h2>
        <h3>or, Notes on the Mythological Figure of the White Terrorist</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Given the fact that my current username includes the word "terror", it is rather appropriate that the first article I publish here is about something exploding.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the record, the inclusion of such a term in my username is purely humourous; there is no way in which it can be construed as a statement of my positions.
                Given that my Twitter bio also includes such ridiculous statements as me supposedly subscribing to an "Ancap-Nazbol synthesis", this should be obvious.
                That said, some dumbass will inevitably come to bizarre conclusions, either before reading this or precisely because of reading this.
            </p>
            <p>
                The event that happened this past Christmas in Nashville, while nontrivial, is not made interesting merely because of the details of what occurred.
                What makes the event interesting are the ripples it had in the popular conciousness, ripples which show the honest side of many Americans.
                For those in the future who might be unfamiliar, on December 25th, 2020, a man named Anthony Quinn Warner set off a homemade bomb in Nashville, Tennessee.
                There were a total of eight people injured, and the only actual death was the perpetrator himself.
                The real damage was to a nearby AT&T network hub, which led to a knockout of communications in the area. Why would he do such a thing?
                Put simply, Warren was loony. He reportedly believed in shape-shifting reptilians, and would often hunt them in the local park.
                Importantly, he was also reportedly paranoid about the mythical 5G Corona, which, if true, paints a clear picture as to why he chose his target.
                Giving credit where it is due, he also broadcasted messages from his RV telling people to evacuate, which is likely why no one died.
                I do not wish to defend Warren more than necessary, but it must be emphasized that he appears to have lacked any notable ill intent.
                This is not a man committing an act of malice; while his methods were extreme, he genuinely believed that he was saving lives by doing this.
                It is interesting, then, how eager people are to pin him in a more nefarious light than necessary (in the context of him, y'know, blowing up a fucking building).
                We did not immediately know why the blast occurred, but once the identity of the attacker was deduced, people jumped at the chance.
                Legions of blue checkmarks descended upon us to remind us of how this was an act of terrorism, and should be treated as such.
                Of these, quite a few were quick to remind us that this was not just any terrorist, but specifically a "white terrorist".
            </p>
            <p>
                The first question we must wrestle with is whether this man's actions constitute terrorism. There is a fundamental problem here: what even is a terrorist?
                His act was clearly criminal in the context of the law, but when does it stop being a "mere" criminal act, and graduate to something greater?
                This question is next to impossible to answer, because the term itself is vague; there's a very good reason why most people can't form a coherent definition.
                If I had to take a stab at it, terrorism is nothing more than a tactic, but often, the tactic and the "I know it when I see it" attidude don't quite align.
                What the term "terrorist" typically signifies, in practice, is the desire of the soverign to invoke a state of exception in response to a certain criminal.
                However, if the designation of a criminal as a terrorist is usually associated with politicians, why were media figures the ones first making the accusations?
                The answer is actually simple: the term contains a great deal of weight, and invoking it can draw an audience.
                Telling your audience that there was an evil man about who could've killed your kids is much scarier than saying a mentally ill guy bombed a 5G Corona factory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This, however, leaves open the question of why him specifically being a "white terrorist" is interesting. What does this term imply?
                It is no secret that, in the wake of 9/11, the popular image of a terrorist is incredibly racialized and secretarian.
                We all know that innocent lives are usually ended by brown guys with scraggly beards with names like Abdul Aziz bin Mahmoud or shit like that.
                For a while, what the term "white terrorist" would've denoted was the image of a white convert to radical Islam who did so out of resentment for the West.
                However, now, the term "white terrorist" invokes a new image, not one of a white Muslim convert, but of a white guy expressing whiteness through violence.
                He is the ultimate villain in the current American landscape: one who simultaneously celebrates and despises difference, with guns aimed as the downtrodden.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brings us two new, important questions. Our first question: does the capital-WT White Terrorist, in this sense, exist? There are definitely examples.
                Perhaps the most infamous in recent memory is Brenton Tarrant. Also notable is Anders Breivik. I could list some more, but I don't particularly care.
                Point is, these people do exist. Now, the second question: was Warren a White Terrorist? No, he was not, at least not from what I'm aware of.
                Of course, I am leaving the possibility open that he could have been racist in his personal life, but being a racist criminal doesn't make you a White Terrorist.
                His actions were less an expression of whiteness and more an expression of mental illness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Warren's insanity is a particularly noteworthy aspect of his case. No reasonable person would deny that mental illness can lead to criminal activities.
                And yet, it seems that many Americans, particularly of the more liberal breed, love to ignore this fact in these sorts of cases.
                It's particularly strong during debates on gun control, with many flat-out combating the relevance of madness, calling it an NRA scapegoat.
                This is, of course, despite the fact that any amount of common fucking sense could tell you that, no, it's not at all irrelevant.
                Many prominent criminals in recent history have clearly been disturbed, or were in some other unfortunate life circumstance.
                At some point, you have to stop treating this as a collection of individual cases and begin considering them as a whole. But no, it's a scapegoat.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the topic of both scapegoats and pathology, we should probably discuss incels, who qualify as both. Incels are another target of the "white terrorist" label.
                For all of human history, there have been guys who didn't fuck. Yet, suddenly, we've decided that these guys are both A) a new thing, and B) the next ISIS.
                Now, when it comes to guys like Elliot Rodger or Alek Minassian, I understand the commotion, what with them killing people.
                When it comes to the general public image of incels, though, it is unncessarily menacing, as opposed to their reality, which is that they are pathetic.
                It is also interesting that the media tries to frame "incel ideology" as an expression of whiteness, which gives it its menacing quality.
                This, of course, ignores the fact that most incels, as least in Western countries, are either Indian or East Asian, but that's beside the point.
                What is it about the "incel ideology" that is inherently white? The answer is nothing. If so, why is the connection made?
                It's for the same reason why films like Falling Down are consistently reduced to be nothing more than bait for so-called "angry white men".
            </p>
            <p>
                It is absolutely not a coincidence that the resurgence of the Evangelical Right and the rise of modern poltically correct Liberalism were simultaneous.
                These two facets of our current Kulturkampf are only opposed to each other on the surface; in fact, they are very much symbiotic.
                The role of the Evangelicals in this dynamic is to whine about the moral decay of America caused by liberals and their crazy antics.
                In the other corner, the PC-types whine about the oppression of various group of people, only to do nothing substantive to actually help them.
                These two sides enter into conflict in the arena of the media, driving the spectacle that has ensnared American life.
                Outside of this direct conflict, though, the Evangelicals also gained another opponent: the ideal Jihadi, set out to molest the West.
                This is an incredibly powerful asset for the Evangelical Right, and it's one that, unfortunately for the PC-types, they can't use.
                Remember, these people are the ones who are supposed to be defeating racism. Why would they use this image?
                This actually presents a problem for them, because the Evangelicals can then threaten their audience with the death of Western civilization.
                If the PC-types wanted to catch up, they would need to find another ideal figure, one who they could convincingly cast as a great destroyer of civilization.
                The figure of the White Terrorist fits this role perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the ideal Jihadi, who is someone who either invades or is imported to the West, the White Terrorist is cast as a disease endemic to Western civilization.
                He is, allegedly, the ultimate expression of chauvinism, a rejection of the Liberal order and everything it claims to stand for.
                He is a cancer who is killing America from the inside out, birthed from redneck scum who are just so wholly ignorant of how the world should be run, obviously.
                If this is a disease, then clearly, it must be cured. It should be blatant exactly who thinks they have the ability, nay, the right, nay, the duty to do so.
                A bunch of fuckin' pricks, that's who. Please ignore the fact that many of said fuckin' pricks have careers founded upon apocalyptic spectacle wrangling.
                Perhaps you are surprised at my pseudo-organicist description of their ideology, given that these fuckin' pricks come from the Liberal tradition.
                I must remind you that anyone can become a Caesarian; this is a truth, not a welcome truth, but a truth nonetheless.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is actually a third target of my derision I shall discuss: the American "Left" and its bizarre fascination with eating its own foot.
                It has often been debated why, historically, there has been no prominent socialist movement in America. These guys certainly don't help one bit.
                First, we must ask, what does "Left-wing" politics stand for in general? Again, there is no consistent definition.
                Over the past couple centuries, movements commonly considered Left-wing that were worth anything focused on the working class and improving material conditions.
                (The exact specifics of how this should be done are still up for debate, but I must emphasize the goal these groups had, in comparison to later movements.)
                Since then, the term has been applied rather brazenly and inappropriately, especially in the United States.
                Remember, people in the U.S. consider the Democratic Party, closer in character to Christian Democracy parties in Europe, to be "radical socialism".
                This innnacurate use of the term is not entirely the fault of the Republicans; the "Left" is also to blame. 
                Many in the U.S. (more boradly, in the Anglo-American imperium, and further, due to its hegemony, the world) who claim to be left are really just hyperliberals.
                Every stereotype that people have of the easily-triggered college student with wacky hair, piercings, BDP, and ecstasy comes from this group.
                More importantly, the charge of propogating useless identity politics comes from this group.
            </p>
            <p>
                I must emphasize a particular point here: this criticism is not just the standard criticism many Left-wing groups get of secretly being liberals.
                (If I may, I'd say that most people, at least in Western countries, could be considered cryptoliberals, but that's a point for another time.)
                What I am trying to get across here is that, in fact, many "Leftists" are not just cryptoliberals, but are something much greater. Hyperliberals, as I said.
                Of course, they may say that they care about class issues or economics, but they're often more into the inverted Freudianism sourced from guys like Marcuse.
                (This particular topic is, again, something that I would like to get deeper into later on, but I feel that the essential image has been drawn here.)
                The thing about this inversion is that, despite resembling a rejection of Liberalism, it is merely a realigned Liberalism, including all the moral grandstanding.
                They therefore fall back into the same patterns, patterns which often manifest in useless Kulturkampf bullshit, as bright as day.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the interesting consequences of this, then, is their relationship with the concept of terrorism, and how it plays out in their discourse.
                This is especially important in light of the next big event labeled as "white terrorism": the storming of Capitol Hill on January 6th, 2021.
                For those in the future, a mob of angry Trump supporters were protesting the counting of electoral votes, which would've officially made Biden the President.
                They eventually broke through the barricade, entering the Capitol, and then proceeded to... well, not much actually happened.
                They didn't do a lot more than pose for photo ops, smoke massive blunts in the rotunda (cool as fuck, btw), and fuck around in Nancy Pelosi's office.
                Of course, a cop did die, but there were four protestors who also died, so, keeping all things equal, they were actually worse off than the police.
                Point is, not much actually happened, especially in comparison to how the media is hyping everything up.
                Reading the news, you'd think that the end of America as we know it was just narrowly avoided.
                For the record, "America as we know it" is in fact dying, but not for any of the reasons most people think.
                To put it briefly, you should be much more worried about someone like Bill Gates than someone like Richard Spencer.
                Even if I don't take any meaningful action regarding what I'm talking about, this single sentence puts me at the most risk compared to anything else here.
                Hopefully, this risk only amounts to a risk of getting deplatformed, but I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being a risk of something much greater.
                We're already seeing calls that "the era of 9/11 is over" and that the greatest threat to America comes from within.
                And, hilariously enough, there's a surprisingly lukewarm reaction to prominent voices essentially targeting their own citizens with the label of the enemy.
                It's extremely pathetic to see people who claim to be anti-authoritarian simping for the cops once they have the right targets.
                There are people who will say "yeah, 9/11 was bad, but we deserved it" but who will see my snide remark about the cops' kill count and call me a fascist.
                You're all bitches, all of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Returning to the case of Warren, the responses the "Left" gave ranged from copying the liberals' cry of "white terrorism" to petty arguments about linguistics.
                All the same, far too many of them stuck with calling him a terrorist. They aren't actually challenging any existing authority.
                These people know that the cells of Gitmo are filled because the term they so carelessly throw around was the magic word, right?
                At least with the Capitol protests, I can better understand how they duped themselves into believing that these guys were worthy of being locked up.
                With Warren, it's even stupider, because no one died except for him, yet they still fantasize about locking him up.
                Do they not at all care about the fact that that whole scenario could've been avoided if he had received proper care? Of course not.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is another fact at play here: QAnon. Warren was pushed to do what he did by his mental illness. The people in D.C., while delusional, probably weren't.
                Some of you people probably thought that I was just being all sunshine and rainbows with these guys. Nope, I'm gonna be slightly critical of them.
                These people were, in fact, delusional, buying into the cult of personality of a dying billionaire. Aaaaand that's where my criticism ends.
                What needs to be understood is why someone would believe in QAnon. So, let's ask the question: why do people believe in QAnon?
                It's pretty simple: the world around these people is collapsing. Everything taken for granted is disappearing, so they, futilely, tried to reverse course.
                The issue is that these people had somehow convinced themselves of Trump's infallibility, so failures under him clearly are the work of a Cabal.
                I must emphasize: many of these people are currently at incredibly low points in their lives, and are doing this to cope.
                To imply that the only reason anyone would do so is out of chauvinism or white identitarianism is completely ignorant and dismissive of their suffering.
                If there's anyone you should be angry about, the second most important people to target are the ones upstairs who are actively promoting the theory.
                Who are the first most important people, then? That would be the ones who created the situation that led to their belief.
                Unforfunately, this is going to be a hard pill to swallow for people who still believe in useless Kulturkampf spectacles.
                Looking at 8chan's Wikipedia article, they say it was associated with multiple mass shootings, the hosting of child pornography, and the promotion of Gamergate.
                The authors of that Wikipedia article should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for thinking that last thing is even comparable to the first two.
                These people are not at all equipped to critically analyze anything about our current situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                And now, here we are, at the beginning of a new height of surveillance capitalism. Norm Ornstein, an architect of the original War on Terror, is back.
                Now, he's pushing for Congress to pass a new law targeting domestic terrorism, specifically white supremacist terrorists. This is a serious problem.
                There is nothing about terrorism that is not already illegal; the only purpose of passing anti-terrorist legislation is giving the government more power.
                Worse yet, there are people supporting this legislation who very well could become targets. If you support both this and BLM, sleep with one eye open.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I originally started writing this article, it was only about Warren. The point was to highlight the use of the White Terrorist as a bogeyman.
                Unfortunately, what I was originally predicting seems to be becoming more and more prominent.
                The U.S. is headed towards a nightmare where people's urge to snitch will become the most powerful weapon of internal warfare.
                This will beat out any Red Scare from past decades. At least those had the excuse of the targets being foreign agents sent to subert the country.
                Now, though, we are beginning the process of excising the supposed infection from the ill body.
                Without any exaggeration, I am proposing that this could very well be the beginning of the end for the United States' position as the leader of the world.
                This sort of scenario is the death rattle of a nation. The government is desperately trying to keep its grasp on public life.
                As a result, we are moving ever closer to the total society, not one incorporating Mussolinian policies, but realizing Gentile's collapse of public and private.
                And, worst of all, a lot of people, otherwise normal people, see this as a good thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who thought 2021 would be better than 2020 now stands corrected.
