        <h2>About Me / FAQ</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Who are you?</h3>
            <p>
                I am Radical Balsamic Terror. I also occasionally go by other names on some other sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm just some guy on the Internet who has a lot of uninformed takes on issues, and they usually end up on my Twitter feed. However, there's a character limit.
                Therefore, whenever I have some longform thoughts on a (semi-)serious issue, I can't put them on Twitter without them being split into a million pieces.
                I eventually decided that I'd make my own website, but I didn't want to pay for hosting, so I compromised and put it on a GitHub Pages website.
                Of course, this isn't quite ideal, considering I can be taken down at any time by GitHub, but I do make a snapshot on the Wayback Machine evey time I post.
                In effect, I guess it's no worse than trusting Twitter to not ban me for my posts. They unfortunately have a monopoly on conversation online.

                As for a bit about who I am, all I'll say on the matter is that I went to school to lean a combination of mathematics and computer science.
                There was some point where I realized that mathematics was the thing I was good at (relative to other areas), and so it became my passion.
                The computer science aspect was purely for practical purposes, because I concluded that any half-decent job I could take would probably be a programming job.
                If I were to try and make a career out of my mathematical training, I probably would've ended up working for a certain three-letter organization.
                Of course, I wasn't a fan of that prospect, so I was willing to settle for a future of lackluster white-collar work. Not much else to report.

            <h3>What does "Radical Balsamic Terror" mean?</h3>
            <p>
                It doesn't really mean anything; it was just some stupid joke I came up with on a whim. Do not take it too seriously.
            </p>
            <p>
                For context, I first thought of the phrase back when all of the Fox News types were hyping up Barack Obama's repeated refusal to address terrorists as "Islamic".
                A lot of them made a big deal about how he was a coward and/or a secret sympathizer, so they tried to one-up him by saying it all the time.
                The specific phrase "radical Islamic terrorism" was oft-repeated, with very little variation, most likely because the same guys write all of their stuff.
                At some point, I thought, "hey, it'd be really funny if one of them said, 'President Obama, if you won't say it, I will: radical balsamic terrorism'".
                That phrase stuck with me, and when I decided to make a Twitter account, I used it as a name, changing "terrorism" to "terror" to not get caught in any filters.

            <h3>Why is this site called "Posts Do Not Represent my Employer"?</h3>
            <p>
                The short answer is that it's a true statement, because my posts don't represent my employer. It's partly a cool name, partly a disclaimer.
                I'd rather people not try and get me fired from any job(s) I may or may not have, even though that's basically the default response in the Liberal mode.
                At the risk of sounding like one of those edgy atheist neckbeards from back in the day, I do see freedom of speech as an essential value.
                It kinda sucks that I have to put any disclaimers at all, but I figured that, if I have to anyway, I might as well make a cool name out of it.
            </p>
            <h3>What do you actually stand for?</h3>
            <p>
                Good question. I'm honestly not sure myself. Part of why I made this website is to have a place where I can write up all of my ideas that are floating around.
                This should not be taken as an indication to treat this website as the sum of all beliefs I have, but someone's gonna do that anyway.
            </p>
            <h3>Why does your website look like total dogshit?</h3>
            <p>
                Actually, my website looks better than most websites currently in existence. This is a fact.
                It may stick out like a sore thumb, what with its lack of fancy visuals, its Web 1.0 design that looks like it came straight from a crap Geocities website, etc.
                But you know what it doesn't have? It doesn't have dozens of in-window pop-ups telling you that using the site amounts to accepting rape.
                It doesn't have that endless scrolling bullshit that's insidiously designed to keep you hooked, as if it were a drug.
                It doesn't have that absolutely horrific Flat Design bullshit that makes every website look like it were designed by a gay art school dropout with a budget.
                This look isn't done out of nostalgia, it's done out of necessity. Every advancement in Internet technology only serves to further penetrate you.
                Honestly, you fuckers should be thanking me that it looks like this, because I'm doing you a favor.
