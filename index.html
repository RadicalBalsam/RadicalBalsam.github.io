                I am Radical Balsamic Terror, A.K.A. @RadicalBalsam on Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am usually a shitposter on Twitter. However, there are some things that I would like to post that would take me more than 280 characters. This is where they go.
                Do not expect much original thought here. Much of what I say here has been said better by other people. I don't care, though. I'll say it anyway.
                Much of it will be nonfiction, but don't be surprised if I suddenly decide to put something else on here on a whim.
                I will indicate if I update any previously-existing publications, but not for very minor changes (i.e. spellchecking, linking to relevant later articles, etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
                More specific details about who I am can be found at my <a href="./about.html">About</a> page.

                If you are at all curious, no, your browser isn't failing to load the CSS. This is just how the page looks. I like it that way.

                If there's anything you want to reach out to me about, contact me by whatever method you want, such as my email address or my Twitter account.
                For example, I write all of my articles in English, but if you wish to volunteer to translate one of them, please get in touch and tell me your plans.
                Oh yeah, and I guess it's also useful if you want to tell me that I'm a horrible human being.
